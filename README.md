# Fantasy Hockey Draft

A **real-time fantasy hockey draft application** built with React, TypeScript, Firebase, and the NHL API. The app provides a complete fantasy hockey league experience including live drafting, automated daily scoring, real-time game stats, roster management, injury tracking, and league chat.

> ⚠️ **Current Status: Single-League Demo**  
> Currently, the app is hardcoded to run a single active league for demonstration purposes. Multi-tenancy (supporting multiple different leagues simultaneously) is planned for v2.
